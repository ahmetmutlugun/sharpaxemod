There are lots of incomplete and buggy items, so don't expect too much. I am working on it.
A mod (obviously) made by sharpaxe.

Currently adds 2 axes, 2 guns, 4 swords and 2 special projectiles.

Sadly I didn't have time to fix the crafting methods for these items so they will be inaccessible/have random recipes for a while.

Next update should release in 2020

I finally fixed my tModLoader so I can develop on my Mac, should make things a lot faster.
