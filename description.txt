There are lots of incomplete and buggy items, so don't expect too much. I am working on it.
A mod (obviously) made by sharpaxe. 

Currently adds 2 axes, 2 guns, 4 swords and 2 special projectiles.

Sadly I didn't have time to fix the crafting methods for these items so they will be inaccessible/have random recipes for a while. 

Next update should release on 4/28/2019

Form this point on I will be working weekly.
